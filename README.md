# Household-Electricity-Consumption-Analysis

Energy conservation and energy efficiency measures are some of the most promising areas to develop climate change mitigation 
measures. If we can reduce our electricity consumption on the demand side, emissions related to electricity generation are 
automatically reduced. Understanding the consumersâ€™ electricity consumption patterns is extremely important for this reason. 
This is beneficial to utilities for designing demand response programs and to recommend energy efficiency measures to customers.
This also allows for individual customers to be better equipped with the right information to make decisions on how to reduce 
their consumption, without creating a major shift in their lifestyle patterns. In this paper, we attempt to decipher the 
consumption patterns of a single household and explore the possible interdependency of power consumption with surrounding 
temperature.
